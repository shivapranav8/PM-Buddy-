When the candidate asks clarifying questions, provide helpful data\n4. Guide them toward a good answer with hints if they're stuck\n5. After the interview ends, you will evaluate them against your internal solution\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n\nFOR THE FIRST MESSAGE:\n- Pick ONE question from Practice Questions in the provided rubric.\n- State it in under 15 words.\n- MATCH THE TONE OF THE ROUND (e.g., for RCA: \"Metrics dropped 30%\"; for Improvement: \"Redesign the home screen\" or \"How would you improve X?\")\n- Do NOT explain or ask \"How would you...\" unless it's the standard way to ask that round's question.\n\nDURING THE INTERVIEW:\n- Keep an internal framework/solution based on the rubric\n- When candidate asks for data (\"Is this only in one city?\"), provide realistic answers\n- If candidate is stuck, give a gentle hint (\"Have you considered breaking this down by user segments?\")\n- DO NOT solve it for them, but guide them\n- ALWAYS answer clarifying questions or data requests directly and helpfully BEFORE moving forward.\n- If the candidate asks a question, your NEXT response MUST answer it.",

Problem Clarification (High Signal)\n**Good signs**: Repeats question in own words, asks clarifying questions, defines scope (geo, time, units)\n**Red flags**: Jumps straight into math, ignores ambiguity, changes scope mid-answer\n\n### 2. Logical Structure (Most Important)\n**Good signs**: Clear top-down breakdown, equation before numbers, MECE-ish decomposition\n**Red flags**: Random numbers thrown in, overly complex equations, no clear path from assumptions to result\n\n### 3. Reasonable Assumptions\n**Good signs**: Assumptions grounded in reality, uses round explainable numbers, acknowledges uncertainty\n**Red flags**: Magic numbers with no justification, over-precision (e.g., 37.4%), inconsistent assumptions\n\n### 4.

First-Principles Reasoning — 10%\n**Strong**: Starts from fundamental user or market needs, challenges assumptions, avoids copying competitors blindly\n**Weak**: Framework recitation, buzzwords without substance, \"because everyone else is doing it\"\n\n### 4. Strategic Options Generation — 10%\n**Strong**: Lays out 2–4 distinct strategic options, covers different levers (price, positioning, ecosystem, business model), explicitly compares options\n**Weak**: One obvious answer, incremental tweaks only, \"we should just do X\"\n\n### 5. Strategic Choice & Prioritization (MOST IMPORTANT) — 20%\n**Strong**: Clearly states which option they'd pursue, explains why others are deprioritized, uses explicit criteria (moat, risk, timing, leverage)\n**Weak**: \"I'd experiment with all of these\", no clear recommendation, avoids trade-offs\n\n### 6. Long-Term Vision & Future Orientation — 10%\n**Strong**: Talks about 3–5 or 5–10 year implications, connects strategy to future user behavior or technology shifts, differentiates short-term tactics from long-term bets\n**Weak**: Present-only thinking, over-focus on current metrics, no vision narrative\n\n### 7. Risk Awareness & Trade-offs — 10%\n**Strong**: Calls out risks unprompted, explains why risks are acceptable or how they're mitigated, acknowledges uncertainty\n**Weak**: Overconfidence, hand-wavy risk handling, ignores downsides\n\n### 8. Metrics & Strategic Success Criteria — 5%\n**Strong**: Uses north-star or directional metrics, differentiates leading vs lagging indicators, links metrics to strategic intent\n**Weak**: Only DAU/revenue, feature-level metrics only, no time horizon\n\n### 9. Strategic Communication & Leadership Signals — 5%\n**Strong**: Clear narrative, thinks out loud, handles pushback calmly and logically, invites alignment\n**Weak**: Rambling, defensive, framework-first insight-last\n\n## Evaluator Mindset\n\"Would I trust this person to set direction for a business under uncertainty?\"\n\n## Expected Approach\n- Clarify the strategic question and business context\n- Ask high-impact questions to uncover core value drivers\n- Synthesize information — balance data with judgment\n- Outline where to play and how to win decisions\n- Reason through alternatives and explain your choice\n\nPractice Questions:\n- Meta is considering entering the professional networking space.
