Check for patterns related to specific devices, browsers, or network conditions.\n\n2. **User Feedback**: Review user feedback or support tickets for mentions of login issues during the period where retention dropped.\n\n3. **Technical Audit**: Conduct a thorough review of recent changes in the login system. This includes code changes, server configurations, or updates that might coincide with the retention drop.\n\n4. **Usability Testing**: Run usability tests with current users to observe any friction points in the login process. This might reveal UI issues or areas that are not user-friendly.\n\n5. **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B tests for different login process variations to identify if simplifying or adjusting certain elements improves retention rates.\n\nOnce the specific cause is identified, solutions could include:\n- Fixing any technical bugs in the login process.\n- Simplifying authentication methods or offering one-click login options.\n- Enhancing the clarity and user guidance during the login phase.\n\nBy addressing the login UI issue, the expectation is to see an improvement in user retention as it will enable users to access meetings more successfully and continue using the platform.",
